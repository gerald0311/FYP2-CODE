# Vehicle Detection in Aerial Images Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and documentation for my final year project titled "Vehicle Detection in Aerial Images Using Machine Learning". The project involves using various deep learning models, including YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8 to detect vehicles in aerial images.

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a robust system for detecting vehicles in aerial images. The system leverages deep learning models such as different version of YOLO to identify and classify different types of vehicles, including cars, buses, trucks, and minibuses.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Roundabout Aerial Images for Vehicle Detection from Kaggle"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/javiersanchezsoriano/roundabout-aerial-images-for-vehicle-detection". It contains high-resolution images and corresponding XML annotation files for vehicle detection. The dataset is split into training and validation sets:
Training Set: 80% of the data (11,937 images)
Validation Set: 20% of the data (2,985 images)
 
# Models
The following models have been implemented and compared in this project:
YOLOv8
YOLOv5 
YOLOv7 

# Results
The results of the different models are compared using various metrics such as mAP, box loss, confusion matrix, and F1 confidence curve. Detailed results and comparisons are provided in the Results section.
